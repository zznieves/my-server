# My-Server

This is a web server to host my portfolio website

## Tools Used

Server was built with help from tools built with JavaScript

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
    - a JavaScript framework to simplify creating web servers and APIs
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
    - a development tool that restarts the server in real time when a change is made to the backend code
